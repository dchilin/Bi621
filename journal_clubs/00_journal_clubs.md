# Journal Club Expectations

We will have 3 days of Journal club presentations. Journal club takes place Friday afternoons from 2PM - 4PM. Two papers will be presented each week.

| Week | Groups presenting | First paper | Second paper |
|---|:----:|:---:|:---:|

## Purpose
The goal of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills that are essential to your success in this course and your future career in bioinformatics.
- Interpret scientific literature
- Distill key points from paper
- Evaluate conclusions drawn by authors by analysing presented data
- Distinguish quality of literature
- Facilitate meaningful discussion of literature

## Tasks
### Presentations
Groups assigned to present a paper should prepare a 30 minute presentation with your group. You should thoroughly read and analyze the paper, **including any supplemental materials**, and be able to answer questions from your peers. It may also be necessary to consult other articles cited in the paper, in order to grasp background details and/or context. Work should be equally distributed among group members.

The presentation should include:
- **Introduction** – include sufficient background to understand the significance, justification, and goals of the work.
- **Results** – present the data and interpretation. Additional figures may be shown to assist in understanding the experimental design and interpretation of the data. Not every figure in the paper needs to be included, but we expect key figures to be shown and discussed. In many cases interpretation will require explanation of study methods. Do not gloss over key methods (either experimental or statistical). If you don't understand key methods, take the time to learn about and teach them to the class!
- **Conclusions and Future Directions** – summarize the main findings and discuss future work that will further answer the questions posed by the work.
- **Discussion** – presenters should facilitate discussion of the paper.

### Participation
Students not presenting the paper are expected to contribute to the discussion by asking thoughtful questions or responding to presenter questions. We will keep track of questions and responses from all students, and we will weight grades accordingly.

### Executive Summary
Everyone not presenting a particular paper should turn in an executive summary of the assigned paper.

Reflect on the following points while reading the journal article and then briefly answer the following questions. Short format answers are acceptable.

1.	(2 points) Overview
    1. What is the main idea that the authors would like to convey?
    2. Were they successful? (e.g. Were the data sufficient? Did they over-interpret their results?)
    3. Was there a clearly stated hypothesis?
2.	(3 points) The data:
    1. Are the data reproducible and/or accessible? How did the authors achive this/not achive this?
    2. Were sufficient controls employed (if applicable)? What were the controls, were they used appropriately?
3.	(2 points) Were the methods appropriate to address the authors' questions?
4.	(2 points) Were there experiments or analyses they didn’t do that could make the data more convincing?  
5.	(1 point) Did the authors' increase confidence in the outcome by supporting their results in multiple ways? 

Only for discussion, consider the following:

6.	What are the general impacts of the paper, based on what others have published? 
7.	Is the bibliography high quality? (does not cite too many review or opinion papers, but mostly peer-reviewed, primary research articles from high-impact journals).
8.	What is one question you have about the paper?

## Grading
Journal clubs will be worth 15% of the course grade broken down as follows:
- 1/3 Presentation: 1 presentation during the course of the class
- 1/3 Participation: over all 3 journal clubs
- 1/3 Executive summary: each student will write 3 executive summaries
